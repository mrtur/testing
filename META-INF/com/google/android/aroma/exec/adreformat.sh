# Used by ArchiDroid for reformatting device-based paths
# Usage: adreformat.sh *path* *fs*, f.e. adreformat /storage/sdcard1 f2fs

# Error codes:
# 0 - All fine, we've unmounted, reformatted, mounted and verified our partition
# 1 - Not enough arguments given
# 2 - No busybox and no mount
# 3 - Invalid filesystem
# 4 - Valid filesystem but no available tool for reformatting this filesystem found
# 5 - We failed to unmount partition prior to reformatting, error skipped during force
# 6 - Invalid path, our guess based on paths below failed or we guessed wrong non-block path
# 7 - We failed reformatting task, check log, this can be a serious problem
# 8 - We failed to mount partition after reformatting


# These are absolute paths without slashes, for example /storage/sdcard1 is storagesdcard1, because you can't use / in variables
